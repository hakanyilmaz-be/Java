/*
1)By using interface we can use multiple inheritance in Java
2)Interface is not a class. Interface is an interface
3)Abstract classes may have abstract and concrete 
  methods but interfaces may have JUST ABSTRACT methods.
4)For interfaces all methods are abstract as default.
  Because of that, no need to use "abstract" keyword
  for methods in an interface.
  "public void seat();" is same with "public abstract void seat();" 
5)When you work in a class, if you remove access modifier it will be "default" but
  when you work in an interface access modifiers of all methods will be public every time
  even you type access modifier or not. 
  "public void seat();" is same with "void seat();"
6)For concrete and abstract classes we use "extends" keyword but for interfaces we use "implements"
  keyword. Both "extends" and "implements" can be used at the same time for a class to achieve 
  multiple inheritance.
7)ALL methods in an interface must be "abstract" because of that interfaces are called 
  "Fully Abstraction", abstract classes are called "Partial Abstraction".
8)When we have abstraction we cannot create objects because of that we cannot create objects 
  by using interfaces.  
9)Class ===> Interface  use "implements"  
  Class ===> Class use "extends"
  Interface ===> Interface use "extends"
  Interface ===> Class !!!! A Class cannot be parent for an Interface !!!  
10)If a concrete class have 2 interface parents, when you create methods with same method signature
   in parent interfaces, do not use different return types. Otherwise, Java cannot decide which one
   to override and starts to complain.
