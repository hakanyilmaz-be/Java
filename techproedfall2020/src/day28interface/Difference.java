    /*
    Differences between "abstract class" and "interface"
    
1) Abstract Class = You can use "abstract" and "concrete" methods
Interface      = You can use just "abstract" methods
                 After Java 8, we are able to use "concrete" methods
                 by using "default"(default methods) or "static" keywords.
                 
2) Abstract Class = You can extend to abstract classes, you can implement interfaces
Interface      = You can extends to interface, you cannot extend/implement to a class

3) Abstract Class = An abstract class cannot have multiple parent class, but it can have
                 multiple parent interface
Interface      = An interface can have multiple parent interfaces, but cannot have any 
                 parent class.
                 
4) Abstract Class = You can use any type of variables
Interface      = All variables are "public", "final" and "static" 

5) Abstract Class = When you create a method, you have to use "abstract" keyword  
Interface      = When you create a method, no need to use "abstract" keyword 
                 All methods in an interface are "public" and "abstract" as default.
                 
                 
        !!! YOU CANNOT CREATE OBJECT BY USING ABSTRACT CLASSES AND INTERFACES

            What is the OOP Concept in Java?
            
            OOP Concept has 4 main features:
            
            1)Abstraction ==> Abstract Class and Interface
            2)Encapsulation ==> Data Hiding, using private access modifier, getter and setter methods
            3)Inheritance ==> parent-child relationship
            4)Polymorphism ==> Overloading + Overriding
