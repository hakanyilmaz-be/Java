	1)When you create a variable in an interface 
	  you must initialize(assign a value) it.
	2)final variables are made bold. In an interface 
	  all variables are "final" as default.
	  In an interface, all variables have constant values. 
	3)All variables in an interface are "static"  
	4)Access modifiers of all variables are "public" 
	  Note: "public final static int NUM =12;" is same with "int NUM = 12;"
	  Note: For names of final variables, use uppercases for all characters.
	5)Until Java 8, it was impossible to create "concrete methods" in an interface. 
	  But in Java 8, Java gave us an option to create "concrete methods" in an interface
	  by using "default" or "static" keywords.  
	  Note: "default" keyword which you use to create concrete
	  method is not access modifier.
